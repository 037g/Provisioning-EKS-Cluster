# Project Summary
This repo contains code and documentation, detailing the design and development of two independent and multi-regional AWS EKS clusters that operate with BLUE/GREEN functionality.

## OBJECTIVES
### //Provisioning
- [x] Using Terraform and/or Ansible, deploy two kubernetes clusters across two separate public cloud regions. 
- [x] Use Global Load Balancing to route traffic between the two clusters
- [x] Configure the ability to direct users to specific application instances 
### //Deployment
- [x] Deploy a simple kubernetes based application across both clusters
- [ ] Automate the deployment of the application using any modern CI / CD tooling
of your choice
- [x] Perform blue/green routing to the application across both clusters
- [ ] BONUSâ€‹ - Automate the traffic routing through a GitOps approach

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```


## Ansible Deployment Scripts
The Ansible Scripts should be run in the following order:

| Run Order  |  Description |
